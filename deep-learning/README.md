Deep Learning Docker Image
================================
Docker image with essential deep learning packages installed ([Keras](https://keras.io/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), etc.).
This is a Dockerized version of my older [Deep Learning VM](https://github.com/nirmalyaghosh/deep-learning-vm) project.

- [CPU](cpu/) : CPU-only version of the image
